 # Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Scikit-Learn
The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font. we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function.<br/>

Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic
machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents.
Think about, for example, the ZIP codes on letters at the post office and the automation
needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary in
order to sort mail automatically and efficiently.
Included among the other applications that may come to mind is OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten text, or pages of
printed books, for general electronic documents in which each character is well
defined.
But the problem of handwriting recognition goes farther back in time, more
precisely to the early 20th Century (1920s), when Emanuel Goldberg (1881–1970) began
his studies regarding this issue and suggested that a statistical approach would be an optimal choice
## Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn
The scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/) enables you to approach this type
of data analysis in a way that is slightly different from what you’ve used in Project 1. The
data to be analyzed is closely related to numerical values or strings, but can also involve
images and sounds.
The problem you have to face in this Internship project involves predicting a numeric
value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.
So even in this case you will have an estimator with the task of learning through
a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model
sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function. Then we will
discuss the training set and validation set, created this time from a series of images.
## The Digits Dataset
The scikit-learn library provides numerous datasets that are useful for testing many
problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Also in this case there is a dataset
of images called Digits.
This dataset consists of 1,797 images that are 8x8 pixels in size. Each image is a
handwritten digit in grayscale,
